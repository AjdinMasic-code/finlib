# finlib
With this library you can: gather fundamental data, historical price data, and earnings data. You can compute financial ratios, do value analysis, risk analysis, easily create predictive models based off historical data, generate trade recommendations, and automatically visualize all of the above information.

*some pieces of the yahoofinancials library have been passed through and are functionally the same, but through the use of memoization have decreased time complexity (gotta go fast)*

probably:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib

Finish finlib basic
Generate financial ratios
Gather data
 
For determining value stocks:
Assume there is some value associated with a stock from a few years ago.
Quantify change in positive and negative financial ratios over the period.
You canâ€™t know what the intrinsic value is, but perhaps you can predict whether the actual value of the stock is properly changing in proportion to what it should be changing. If there is a significant increase in the fundamental health of a stock that is not reflected in the price proportionally, it might be an undervalued stock. Likewise if there is a small increase in the underlying value but a large increase in the price, it may be overvalued. If there is a proportional increase they may be on par with each other, etc etc for decreases as well. If there is a decrease in stock price, but only a very proportionally small decrease in fundamentals - people may have overestimated how bad some occurence was meaning it is time to buy the stock. Create a formula for testing this and implement a tool to test this just by entering a ticker.

Look at the line of best fit for the figures and ratios that are most relevant, and  consider the average of ratios that are important as well (for instance - return on assets/equity/capital/debt).

The above should simply be a tool - obviously the situation needs to evaluated empirically as well
